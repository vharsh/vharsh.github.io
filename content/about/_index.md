### self.Introduction

Harsh Vardhan is an _AmazingHooman_, who is up and out before the lark. In real life, he has five thumbs when
he needs to conform, but lights up to an opportunity to jump in and change things. His laziness has prompted him to swap
the Escape and CapsLock keys in the keyboard among other things to make the former situation akin the latter.


## self.Alias

On the internet he goes by the aliases [@vharsh](https://github.com/vharsh), [thevharsh](https://linkedin.com/in/thevharsh),
except when he can't. He gets to share an identity with a bunch of other cool _Harsh_, but hasn't yet made it to
[this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harsh_Vardhan) list just yet.


## self.Boredom

Speaking of tech stuff, he is an open source enthusiast from IndiaðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³. When he is bored he likes to take things apart.
Besides coding, he finds solace in in organizing things, cooking and working out.


## self.Work
He makes storage seamless for k8s users as part of his day job and brings down systems during the evening at
[MayaData](https://mayadata.io).


### self.Hacking_Education

He has done a bachelors in Computer Science Engineering from [KIIT Univeristy](https://cse.kiit.ac.in/), class of 2018
which has given him a balanced mix of academics, a sense of scale of the real world problems out in the wild world and the
confidence to pair up with like minded [_hackers_](http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html).
He strongly believes that bunch of focused minds can take up a problem and narrow down to a viable solution.
